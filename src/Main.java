SCRABBLE BOT 2

Scrabble bot 2 will take as INPUT:
 - A 2D array, which will be 15 by 15 and will represent the board.
 - Player's Letters

Scrabble bot 2 will OUTPUT:
 - The inputted 2D array appended with a word that would yield the most points and 5 runner-ups.
 - The amount of points gained by playing that word.

GOALS:
The code:
- Returns the word which would yield the most points and the amount of points.
- Takes into consideration letter and word boosts.
- Suggests all and only legal moves.
- Does not return false positives and does not reject false negatives when searching wordLists.
- Runtime per move is under 60 seconds.

/*
The code could use a combination of Butts and patternMatcher.
DoLettersMatch and a dictionary Letter:Points_for_it could also prove useful
